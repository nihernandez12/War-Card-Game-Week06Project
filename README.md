"# Week06Project" 
This is a war card game that was created using Java. You are able to play the game by typing in the console when you run the project in Eclipse. This is an automated verion of the card game WAR. This version uses classes and objects to create the game. This is the first project that I created through the Promineo Teach Back End Software Boot Camp.
